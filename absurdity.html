<h1>
    Does Life’s Absurdity Contradict its Meaning? 
</h1>

<p>
    The meaning of life is a philosophical quandary that many have attempted to tackle; the high-level of consciousness that humans possess make it so that such a question can be conceived and understood. But does it have an answer? Many turn to religion, science, or astrology, in an attempt to extract some reasoning that could justify why they matter; however, in all ways of looking at it, when considering the vastness of the cosmos and seemingly eternal nature of time itself, it becomes increasingly obvious that the meaning of life is likely inconsequential. However, just because life itself may be meaningless, it doesn’t necessarily imply that life can’t bring about a sense of meaning. The question on whether or not this is true, is best answered after considering the writings of Thomas Nagel and Susan Wolf. The former which discusses the absurdity and meaninglessness of life and the latter explaining what it means for one to find meaning in life. After explaining the premises laid out in their two papers, I will explain why the meaning of life is that it’s transcendentally meaningless and what I believe constitutes a meaningful life.

In Thomas Nagel’s paper, “The Absurd”, he elaborates on the absurdity of life, citing that it isn’t directly because we are “insignificant” with regards to the cosmos or time, but rather, it’s the contradiction between our decision to live with utmost seriousness and the reality of our insignificance that makes it so. Our lives are absurd because there is no transcendental meaning to them, yet in many ways, we live as though there is. And while life itself may be meaningless, the absurdity of life, Nagel argues, is only present in humans. The lives of animals are not intrinsically absurd because they lack the capacity for self reflection and self consciousness. A dog will never ask (nor even have the capacity to ask) whether or not their life has meaning or whether or not any of their actions will result in something meaningful. They are unaware of any potential deeper understanding of their life and are moved by innate desires; whereas humans are capable of recognizing it yet still choose to live as though they didn’t. Many people go to work everyday for a job they hate, many regret their actions that they’ve done in the past, many constantly worry about the future of themselves and their family, all to be able to take a step back and realize that it doesn’t really matter.

<p>In an optimistic sense, we should view our ability to question our importance as a positive one, to fuel a life of happiness and one that has meaning. And what exactly constitutes a life with meaning is best explained by Susan Wolf’s paper, “The Meaning in Lives”, where she lays out a framework in which, she believes, can determine whether or not an individual's life is meaningful. It is important to distinguish the notion of the superior meaning of life from having meaning in life. The former is better explained in Nagel’s argument on absurdity, where no matter what we do or what we accomplish, in the grand scheme of the universe, our lives mean nothing. The latter is what Wolf’s paper elaborates on–that one can still live a meaningful life despite (or which I will claim to be because of) the lack of a transcendent meaning. Wolf argues that in order for a life to be meaningful, it must have both subjective and objective value. Briefly put, subjective value is that which brings the agent fulfillment. One could simply smoke cigarettes all day if it provides them with subjective pleasure, thus satisfying the first criterion. The second, objective value, has to do with whether or not you intentionally brought about objective good to society or the world. In the previous example, it is evident that the agent’s life-long endeavor of smoking cigarettes doesn’t have objective value. Thus, by Wolf’s standards, the individual would not have lived a meaningful life. A common counter argument to Wolf’s framework is whether or not objective value or worth can exist without humans attributing value to it. Or simply put, can something be objectively positive, valuable, or even beautiful, without humans deeming it so? In order to fully accept Wolf’s claim, we must reject the idea that objective value is dependent on the subjective nature of human perception, and that true objective value exists for the sole reason that it exists. In other words, the Universe doesn’t need  the opinions of humans to determine that value of something or an idea, something can intrinsically have value for the sake of having that value.

While I believe that Nagel’s claim that human lives are absurd/meaningless can co-exist with Wolf’s construction of the meaning in lives, I also believe that meaninglessness of life is in fact the meaning of life itself. And furthermore, I believe that an individual’s life is most meaningful when they are aware of its transcendent meaninglessness but still strive to have objective value in their life. Before providing an example of an individual who, in my opinion, has lived a meaningful life, it is important to first understand what I mean when I claim that the meaning of life is that it has no meaning.

When we ask what the meaning of life is, we really are asking if there is some universal reason as to why we are here; if there is a bigger purpose to our existence that’s not so obvious. It’s easy to claim that life is transcendentally meaningless and stop there––but is it outlandish to claim that that in itself can be the meaning? For something to have purpose and value, it has to serve something greater. In the case of asking what the purpose or meaning of life is (or the purpose of anything for that matter), you have to assume that the answer to the question is of greater value or importance than the idea or object in question (in this case life). For example, the purpose of a microwave is to heat up food to resolve hunger, the purpose of a bed is to allow people to comfortably sleep, and the purpose of a home is to keep people safe, etc. In these examples, the purpose is always to lead to something of higher value such as human enjoyment, comfort, and safety. In these cases, the value of the outcome or purpose trumps the individual value of the object in question (microwave, bed, house etc.). In other words, if you stripped the purpose of a bed or house away, then its value would quickly diminish. In these trivial cases, the purpose is to invoke some form of positive human emotion. And as you work your way through the hierarchy of a concept/object and its purpose and then recursively asking the same question of what’s the purpose of that, you will undoubtedly end up working your way to the question of highest value. What is the purpose or meaning of life? Unlike before, there is no correct answer, because, to us, there is no obvious idea or thing that has greater value than life itself—and it’s very likely that there isn’t. It’s plausible that this hierarchy of purposes stops at the meaning of life where all it points to is nothingness. Consider a scientific analogy of the current state of the universe. The position of every object in the universe, including every human, animal, planet, star etc. is a result of a series of previous reasons. It could be that a star exploded and caused the formation of more planets and solar systems. It could also be because of some other cosmic event. But in this world where we accept that science is the truth, if you keep working back to the reason for something and then the reason for that (and continue), you will end up at the Big Bang. But what caused the Big Bang? Scientists still don’t know, in fact many suggest that there may not have been anything that caused it and that our understanding of the universe and existence makes us believe that we are required to have a cause for it–but it’s very possible that there wasn’t. It’s very possible that the only pointable cause for the Big Bang was nothingness. In the same way that there may not have been an external cause for the Big Bang (which can be considered to be “the first cause”), it’s similarly understandable that there may not be a meaning for life other than that it has no meaning. Thus making the lack of a greater meaning to be, in my opinion, the meaning itself.

The question of what the meaning of life is, is a fundamentally different question from what makes a life meaningful. I previously explained why I believe that the meaning of life is that it has no meaning. But what does that mean for us? Does that mean we sit around all day and do nothing because our lives are meaningless? I don’t believe so. I believe that there is still a way to live a meaningful life. As mentioned previously, Wolf believes a life that has both subjective and objective value is what makes it meaningful. While I agree with her to a certain extent, I believe lives are most meaningful when they have objective value but are able to simultaneously contextualize that life is transcendentally meaningless. This is best explained when considering three individuals, the first will be a Nobel Prize winner in Physics who has made significant contributions to their field; I will refer to him as the “scientist”. This individual is fully consumed in their work and despite its seeming significance, never questions or accepts that, transcendentally, their work and life are both meaningless. Now, consider another individual dubbed the “moper”. This person fully accepts life’s absurdity and meaninglessness and, while they may not be always constantly thinking about it, their significant actions are taken under the understanding of life’s absurdity. This individual is severely depressed by their understanding of life and frequently mopes around; their life lacks the “objective” value that was previously discussed (in Wolf’s sense). The last individual, will be referred to as the “realized man”; he is as ordinary as the moper, and is not as objectively-accomplished as the scientist. Unlike the moper, but like the scientist, his life undoubtedly has objective value (the reason for this value irrelevant, all that matters is that his life has it). And like the moper, but unlike the scientist, he’s aware of his insignificance. He can be viewed as a middle-man between the two, a perfect combination between the two positive qualities in the previous examples. He doesn’t have to be perfect, he doesn’t have to win a Nobel prize, or save the world, he can very much be a regular person working a 9-5 job. In a sense, his life is the most beautiful out of the three, as he understands the deeper meaning of life, that it has no greater meaning, yet strives to make it meaningful to the world around him in the time that he has. Like most people he will feel happy when times are happy, he will feel sad when times are sad, but regardless of the situation, he’s found meaning in a place where very few ever have. He has the humility to contextualize how on a transcendental level, his life, his actions, his words, mean nothing; and he will carry that idea with him in most that he does. But at the same time, he refuses to remain complacent and depressed like the moper; he strives to benefit others and society to some degree (even if it’s small) and willingly chooses to use his deeper understanding of life as a means and motivation to establish his mark on the world.

While it may be counterintuitive or even depressing that the meaning of life is that it has no meaning and that an element of meaningful life is one that understands that; in a sense you can view it as a thing of beauty. That we are here for nothing more than to just live. We won’t be here forever, so live how you want. Do what makes you happy even if in the grand scheme of things it means nothing. Try to live with this understanding, not only because it will allow you to view the lower points in your life on a lighter note, or deal with sadness much easier, but because if you do, it can make your life all the more meaningful.
