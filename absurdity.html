<h1>
    Does Life’s Absurdity Contradict its Meaning? 
</h1>

<p>
    The meaning of life is a philosophical quandary that many have attempted to tackle; the high-level of consciousness that humans possess make it so that such a question can be conceived and understood. But does it have an answer? Many turn to religion, science, or astrology, in an attempt to extract some reasoning that could justify why they matter; however, in all ways of looking at it, when considering the vastness of the cosmos and seemingly eternal nature of time itself, it becomes increasingly obvious that the meaning of life is likely inconsequential. However, just because life itself may be meaningless, it doesn’t necessarily imply that life can’t bring about a sense of meaning. The question on whether or not this is true, is best answered after considering the writings of Thomas Nagel and Susan Wolf. The former which discusses the absurdity and meaninglessness of life and the latter explaining what it means for one to find meaning in life. After explaining the premises laid out in their two papers, I will explain why the meaning of life is that it’s transcendentally meaningless and what I believe constitutes a meaningful life.

In Thomas Nagel’s paper, “The Absurd”, he elaborates on the absurdity of life, citing that it isn’t directly because we are “insignificant” with regards to the cosmos or time, but rather, it’s the contradiction between our decision to live with utmost seriousness and the reality of our insignificance that makes it so. Our lives are absurd because there is no transcendental meaning to them, yet in many ways, we live as though there is. And while life itself may be meaningless, the absurdity of life, Nagel argues, is only present in humans. The lives of animals are not intrinsically absurd because they lack the capacity for self reflection and self consciousness. A dog will never ask (nor even have the capacity to ask) whether or not their life has meaning or whether or not any of their actions will result in something meaningful. They are unaware of any potential deeper understanding of their life and are moved by innate desires; whereas humans are capable of recognizing it yet still choose to live as though they didn’t. Many people go to work everyday for a job they hate, many regret their actions that they’ve done in the past, many constantly worry about the future of themselves and their family, all to be able to take a step back and realize that it doesn’t really matter.
